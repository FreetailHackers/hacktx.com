           blockchain technologies of the future. We are thrilled to be partnering with Freetail Hackers to host a blockchain track for the first time 
           ever, and looking forward to onboarding hundreds of students into the Web3 space. We will be hosting workshops before HackTX '22, and have 
           some of the largest protocols and companies sponsoring the blockchain track (over $70K+ in grants and prizes)!

In order to qualify for the contest, you must launch an app that writes to the DeSo blockchain and implements DeSo identity. While social media apps are a great fit for DeSo, you can also build financial apps, marketplaces, and more on the DeSo blockchain. For inspiration on project ideas, you can check out some of the existing 200+ apps already live on DeSo at [Bithunt.com](http://bithunt.com/) as well as our DeSo APIs.
